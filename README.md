I would like to refine this project and improve upon it, but as I am currently out of time and past my turn-in due-date, I am going to submit it as-is.
I have fully enjoyed working on this project and will use the skills I learned while building it as I continue my coding journey.

Future improvements to consider: 

  unit conversion in the forecast section (from °F to °C and back) 
  
  add SheCodes weather icon img instead of FontAwesome img
  
  higher contrast between background and weather icon images
